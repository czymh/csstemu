Visualization
==============

The following is the visualizations produced from CSST simulations.

Firstly, we show the density field in 200 Mpc/h box for different cosmologies.

.. figure:: ./pic/field200Mpc_over_h.png
   :alt: Density Field in 200 Mpc/h Box for Different Cosmologies

Then we illustrate the plots at smaller scales.
Much larger changes between different subplots than previous plot, which indicates much information hiden in small scales.

   :alt: Halo in Different Cosmologies


Other visualizations are coming soon.
