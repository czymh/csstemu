Welcome to CSST Emulator's documentation!
===================================

**CSST Emulator** is a cosmological emulator for China Space Station Telescope (CSST) optical survey.
This is a pure Python package that provides a simple and intuitive API for predicting the commonly used statistics, 
e.g., matter power spectrum.
Its trainning data includes **129** high-resolution N-body simulations, which are generated by 
the modified version of the `Gadget-4` code with **129** different cosmologies.
So it can achieve a high accuracy in a wide range of cosmological parameters as followed.

| Parameter | Lower Limit | Upper Limit |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| $\Omega_b$          | 0.04  | 0.06    |
| $\Omega_m$          | 0.24  | 0.40    |
| $H_0$               | 60    | 80      |
| $n_s$               | 0.92  | 1.00    |
| $A_s\times 10^{9}$  | 1.7   | 2.5     |
| $w$                 | -1.3  | -0.7    |
| $w_a$               | -0.5  | 0.5     |
| $\sum M_{\nu}$      | 0     | 0.3     |
