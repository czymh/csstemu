## China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Emulator

A python package for CSST cosmological emulator.
This is only dependent on `numpy` and `scipy` packages.
All the gaussian process trainings have been done in advance.
Therefore, the whole package predicts the cosmological statistics accroding to the matrix calculation.
Up to now, the supportted statistics include:
1. `Pkmm`: Matter power spectrum ($0\geq z \leq3$)
2. blabla
3.
